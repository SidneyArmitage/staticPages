            <div class="unit"><h3>Understanding a legacy codebase with no test coverage</h3>
              <p>
                When I first joined Iress, I was assigned to a team of fellow new joiners to work on a legacy codebase
                with no existing engineers to assist. This project required significant uplift involving re-writing the
                CI/CD pipelines, migrating databases and adding unit tests.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Performed discovery on the codebase & created documentation to transfer this knowledge to current
                  and future team members</li>
                <li>Assisted in the setup and configuration of junit</li>
                <li>Setup jest test framework & required tests to be part of quality gates delivering
                  confidence to the team</li>
                <li>Team has confidence in changes made to this project & allowed changes were delivered predicably &
                  reliably</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Integrating microservices using mutual TLS for authentication</h3>
              <p>To achieve this the team had to develop a shared understanding of TLS, how it works and how to debug
                any issues in this specialised problem space.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Colaborate with other engineers to walk through problems and describe the problem space using diagrams</li>
                <li>Developed an understanding of mutual TLS</li>
                <li>Overcame challenges debugging & resolving mutual TLS errors through research & collaboration</li>
                <li>The project was shipped to production & the team developed substantial knowledge from working with
                  SSL</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Integrating a webcomponent being developed by another team</h3>
                <p>
                  During a project to deliver new functionality for a client it was discovered that another team was
                  delivering the same value in another product. It was decided that that team would use a webcomponent
                  that we could integrate with. During this process we had to specify our needs to the team & they would
                  communicate how we would integrate with it. However once the component was delivered, it was discovered that the project
                  had deviated from the specification. Our team had to communicate, remediate the deviations &
                  integrate the component.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Established paths of communication to align, identify & resolve issues</li>
                <li>This component was integrated successfully and is stable with ongoing development on the
                  webcomponent for other use cases</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Implementing session management for a set of microservices</h3>
              <p>This project was developed in the team, from design to implementation. I was involved in creating the
                initial system design, facilitating the workshops on this & then working on the implementation. During  
                delivery I facilitated a threat model process during which we discovered and remediated unacceptable
                risks.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I created documentation & diagrams to communicate & plan work to be completed</li>
                <li>Facilitated a threat analysis process and used an iterative approach to address security concerns</li>
                <li>Delivered a system with high confidence & a solid understanding of its workings</li>
