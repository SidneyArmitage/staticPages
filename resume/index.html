            <div class="unit"><h3>Understanding a legacy codebase with no test coverage</h3>
              <p>
                Initially, at Iress Sidney was assigned to a team of fellow new recruits to work on a legacy codebase. This project required significant uplift involving re-writing the
                CI/CD pipelines, migrating databases and adding unit tests. 
              </p>
              Specifically:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Discovery on the codebase & documentation to transfer this knowledge to current
                  and future team members</li>
                <li>Setup the Jest test framework & requiring tests to be part of quality gates delivering
                  confidence to the team</li>
                  <li>Assisting in the setup and configuration of JUnit</li>
              </ul>
              Outcome:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Enabling code changes to be delivered predictably &
                  reliably</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Integrating microservices using TLS for authentication</h3>
              <p>While integrating a backend microservice, the team developed a shared understanding of TLS, how it works and how to debug
                any issues in this specialised problem space.</p>
                Specifically:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Collaboration with other engineers to walk through problems and describe the problem space using diagrams</li>
                <li>Development of an understanding of TLS</li>
                <li>Overcoming challenges debugging & resolving TLS errors through research & collaboration</li>
              </ul>
              Outcome:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>The project was shipped to production & the team developed substantial knowledge from working with
                  TLS</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Problem solving the integration of a web-component being developed by another team</h3>
                <p>
                  During a project to deliver new functionality another team was assigned to develop the web-component. Sidney's team had to specify needs to the other team &
                  communicate the integration solution. However once the component was delivered, it was discovered that the project
                  had deviated from the specification.
                </p>
                Specifically:
                <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Establishment of communication paths to identify & resolve issues</li>
                <li>Identification of processes to prevent regressions</li>
              </ul>
              Outcome:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>This component was integrated successfully and is stable</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="unit"><h3>Implementing session management for a set of microservices</h3>
              <p>Sidney's team was tasked with the design & implementation of session management for a set of microservices. This involved creating the session management service & ensuring that the solution was secure.</p>
                Specifically:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Led the
                  initial system design & facilitated the workshops</li>
                <li>Creation of documentation & diagrams to communicate & plan the project using JIRA</li>
                <li>Facilitation of a threat analysis process and an iterative approach to address security concerns</li>
              </ul>
              Outcome:
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>A secure system delivered with high confidence</li>
