    <p>Dear Olive Moore</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I hope this finds you well, I am contacting you for the Dedami Consulting graduate position that I saw advertised on Wattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a creatively minded problem solver with proven business experience which afforded me extensive experience with corporate processes especially in regards to being an agent of change and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect to complete a Bachelor of commerce from ANU specialising in finance which, combined with an existing Bachelor of Information Technology from Macquarie University which sets me up to be a exemplary well rounded asset to whatever project I am specifying or enabling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please peruse my attached resume and I look forward to meeting you at an interview.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Kind regards,
      <br>
      Sidney Armitage
